## Microservice Best Practices


- Twelve-factor design helps you to decouple components of the application, so that each component can be replaced easily or scaled up or down seamlessly
  01. Codebase :
    - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
    - Use a version control system like Git or SVN.
    - Each app has one code repo and vice versa.
  02. Dependencies :Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
  03. Config
  04. Backing Services
  05. Build, release, run
  06. Processes
  07. Port binding
  08. Concurrency
  09. Disposability
  10. Dev/prod parity
  11. Logs
  12. Admin processes
